# Service Design Specification
**db-guestmanagement-service** documentation
-Version:**`1.0.2`**

## Scope

This document provides a structured architectural overview of the `guestManagement` microservice, detailing its configuration, data model, authorization logic, business rules, and API design. It has been automatically generated based on the service definition within Mindbricks, ensuring that the information reflects the source of truth used during code generation and deployment.

The document is intended to serve multiple audiences:

* **Service architects** can use it to validate design decisions and ensure alignment with broader architectural goals.
* **Developers and maintainers** will find it useful for understanding the structure and behavior of the service, facilitating easier debugging, feature extension, and integration with other systems.
* **Stakeholders and reviewers** can use it to gain a clear understanding of the service's capabilities and domain logic.

> **Note for Frontend Developers**: While this document is valuable for understanding business logic and data interactions, please refer to the [Service API Documentation](#) for endpoint-level specifications and integration details.

> **Note for Backend Developers**: Since the code for this service is automatically generated by Mindbricks, you typically won't need to implement or modify it manually. However, this document is especially valuable when you're building other services—whether within Mindbricks or externally—that need to interact with or depend on this service. It provides a clear reference to the service's data contracts, business rules, and API structure, helping ensure compatibility and correct integration.



## `GuestManagement` Service Settings [**Edit**](guestmanagement/serviceSettings)

Manages guest profiles and operational data for the single hotel. Supports full staff CRUD on guest records for operations and compliance.

### Service Overview

This service is configured to listen for HTTP requests on port `3000`, 
serving both the main API interface and default administrative endpoints.

The following routes are available by default:

* **API Test Interface (API Face):** `/`
* **Swagger Documentation:** `/swagger`
* **Postman Collection Download:** `/getPostmanCollection`
* **Health Checks:** `/health` and `/admin/health`
* **Current Session Info:** `/currentuser`
* **Favicon:** `/favicon.ico`

The service uses a **PostgreSQL** database for data storage, with the database name set to `db-guestmanagement-service`.

This service is accessible via the following environment-specific URLs:

* **Preview:** `https://db.prw.mindbricks.com/guestManagement-api`
* **Staging:** `https://db-stage.mindbricks.co/guestManagement-api`
* **Production:** `https://db.mindbricks.co/guestManagement-api`

                                 

### Authentication & Security
- **Login Required**: No

This service does not require user authentication for access. It is designed to be publicly accessible, allowing anonymous users to interact with its endpoints.
However, certain CRUD routes may still require login based on their specific configurations.

  
### Service Data Objects
The service uses a **PostgreSQL** database for data storage, with the database name set to `db-guestmanagement-service`.

Data deletion is managed using a **soft delete** strategy. Instead of removing records from the database, they are flagged as inactive by setting the `isActive` field to `false`.



| Object Name | Description | Public Access |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| `guest` | Stores guest profile and contact information for the single hotel. Used for reservation records and hotel operations. | accessPublic | 




## guest Data Object

### Object Overview
**Description:** Stores guest profile and contact information for the single hotel. Used for reservation records and hotel operations.

This object represents a core data structure within the service and acts as the blueprint for database interaction, API generation, and business logic enforcement. 
It is defined using the `ObjectSettings` pattern, which governs its behavior, access control, caching strategy, and integration points with other systems such as Stripe and Redis.

### Core Configuration
- **Soft Delete:** Enabled — Determines whether records are marked inactive (`isActive = false`) instead of being physically deleted.
- **Public Access:** accessPublic — If enabled, anonymous users may access this object’s data depending on API-level rules.








### Properties Schema

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `fullname` | String | Yes | Full name of the guest. |
| `email` | String | No | Guest&#39;s email address for contact or info purposes. |
| `phoneNumber` | String | No | Guest&#39;s phone number, used for record or contact as needed. |
| `address` | Text | No | Full postal address of the guest. |
| `notes` | Text | No | Internal staff comments for the guest record (not exposed to guests). |
* Required properties are mandatory for creating objects and must be provided in the request body if no default value is set.



### Default Values
Default values are automatically assigned to properties when a new object is created, if no value is provided in the request body.
Since default values are applied on db level, they should be literal values, not expressions.If you want to use expressions, you can use transposed parameters in any business API to set default values dynamically.

- **fullname**: 'default'



### Auto Update Properties

`fullname` `email` `phoneNumber` `address` `notes`

An update crud API created with the option `Auto Params` enabled will automatically update these properties with the provided values in the request body. 
If you want to update any property in your own business logic not by user input, you can set the `Allow Auto Update` option to false.
These properties will be added to the update API's body parameters and can be updated by the user if any value is provided in the request body.

 

 

 

### Elastic Search Indexing

`fullname` `email` `phoneNumber` `address`

Properties that are indexed in Elastic Search will be searchable via the Elastic Search API. 
While all properties are stored in the elastic search index of the data object, only those marked for Elastic Search indexing will be available for search queries.











### Filter Properties

`fullname` `email` `phoneNumber`

Filter properties are used to define parameters that can be used in query filters, allowing for dynamic data retrieval based on user input or predefined criteria.
These properties are automatically mapped as API parameters in the listing API's that have "Auto Params" enabled.

- **fullname**: String  has a filter named `fullname`

- **email**: String  has a filter named `email`

- **phoneNumber**: String  has a filter named `phoneNumber`







## Business Logic


guestManagement has got 5 Business APIs to manage its internal and crud logic. 
For the details of each business API refer to its chapter.

* [Create Guest](/businessLogic/createguest)

* [Update Guest](/businessLogic/updateguest)

* [Get Guest](/businessLogic/getguest)

* [Delete Guest](/businessLogic/deleteguest)

* [List Guests](/businessLogic/listguests)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Workflow
1. **Data Model Implementation**: Generate database schema from data object definitions
2. **CRUD Route Generation**: Implement auto-generated routes with custom logic
3. **Custom Logic Integration**: Implement hook functions and edge functions
4. **Authentication Integration**: Configure with project-level authentication
5. **Testing**: Unit and integration testing for all components

### Code Generation Expectations
- **Database Schema**: Auto-generated from data objects and relationships
- **API Routes**: REST endpoints with customizable behavior
- **Validation Logic**: Input validation from property definitions
- **Access Control**: Authentication and authorization middleware

### Custom Code Integration Points
- **Hook Functions**: Lifecycle-specific custom logic
- **Edge Functions**: Full request/response control
- **Library Functions**: Reusable business logic
- **Templates**: Dynamic content rendering

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Testing
- Test all custom library functions
- Test validation logic and business rules
- Test hook function implementations

#### Integration Testing
- Test API endpoints with authentication scenarios
- Test database operations and transactions
- Test external integrations
- Test event emission and Kafka integration

#### Performance Testing
- Load test high-traffic endpoints
- Test caching effectiveness
- Monitor database query performance
- Test scalability under load
